Soil Salinity Management: Almond trees are relatively sensitive to sodium, chloride, and boron. If the salt levels within the soil are high, they must be leached from the soil. This process is typically done with either an application of a leaching fraction in-season or applications of water during the dormant season, when evapotranspiration rates are low. In this study, 6 acre-inches are added in early January each year to leach salt and to refill the soil profile.
Pesticide and fertilizer applications are made by either chemigation (pesticides and/or fertilizers applied through the irrigation water), by UTV mounted ground or spot sprayer or foliar-broadcast by tractor pulled, PTO driven air-blast sprayer.
