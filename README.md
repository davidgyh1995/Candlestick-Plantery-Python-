# Candlestick-Plantery-Python-

A visualization trading tool that can combine both planetary cycles, aspects, and phasings to any stocks/commodities trend and make a future predictions. 

## Description

It was an interesting side project that I learn in-depth about the use of pandas and matplotlib. The story goes one time I happen to read a book about ancient astrology on how ancients used astrology to guide their social practice from predicting yields in agriculture to the rise and fall of destiny. The knowledge is kept and passed along and developed throughout the generations. In modern-day, some have tried to integrate this knowledge with the financial market to study cycles, trends, prices, and much more. Personally, I hold open-minded but cautious skepticism on this theory and looking to test it myself. Hence, I built this software for the hopes of two reasons, one is to test out the theory and possibly guild my future tradings, and two is to practice the use of pandas in dealing with massive amounts of data and use matplotlib to interact with it. 

### Functions:
* planetary cycles and planetary aspects divisions in the long-term horizon
* planetary lines to show support and resistance in real-time trading
* Multi-planetary influences on cycles shifts
